# What this project is for

Originally, SNU didn't have a way of showing the actors in a video/movie/TV series (a feature that sites like Netflix have) I decided to make the add-on, but with the improvement of more functionality and customization abiltiies, along with the ability to display alongside content other than videos (such as images, books, blogs, programs, and more)

The project is currently written in PHP (and soon: HTML and CSS for testing, also possibly JavaScript and Ruby) It is just a little side element, and shouldn't require too much work compared to other semi-advanced SNU modules.
